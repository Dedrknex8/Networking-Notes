# OSI model

> Let's first start with OSI model what it is and why it's used?

## OSI model stands for `Open System Interconnection`

- It's developed by ISO `International Organization for Standardization`

- OSI model consist of 7 layers 
```
+---+    +----------------------------------+
| 7 |    |        Application Layer         |
+---+    +----------------------------------+
+---+    +----------------------------------+
| 6 |    |        Presentation Layer        |
+---+    +----------------------------------+
+---+    +----------------------------------+
| 5 |    |        Session Layer             |
+---+    +----------------------------------+
+---+    +----------------------------------+
| 4 |    |        Transport Layer           |
+---+    +----------------------------------+
+---+    +----------------------------------+
| 3 |    |        Network Layer             |
+---+    +----------------------------------+
+---+    +----------------------------------+
| 2 |    |        Data Link Layer           |
+---+    +----------------------------------+
+---+    +----------------------------------+
| 1 |    |        Physical Layer            |
+---+    +----------------------------------+

```

### Layer 1 {Physical Layer}

- It is the lowest layer in OSI model which is responsible for the actual physical connection b\w the devices. The physical layer contains the info the form of bits.
- responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next. 
- Node is defined as - Devices connected to each other are called asÂ **nodes.**
- And the term used for wireless n\w is known as **Station**
- Devices operating at Physical layer are :
	*  Transceivers : it is a part of network interface that sends and receives signals over the network media
	* Repeater : A device that amplifies electronic signal to extend the maximum allowable distance for a media type.
	* -Hubs : A multiport repeater.
	*  Media Converters : Converts one media signaling type to another.
	- Modems : converts between digital and analog signal transmission
